This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Task for the `Fresher React JS Developers`
----

## Objective:
Create a responsive image gallery using React JS with the following features: reordering, deleting multiple images, and setting a feature image. The gallery should be visually appealing and provide a seamless user experience.

## Task Requirements:
1. **Gallery Layout:**
   - Implement a grid layout for the image gallery.
   - The gallery should display images with one feature image larger than the others.
2. **Sorting:**
   - Enable reordering functionality to allow users to rearrange the order of images in the gallery.
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality or any other intuitive method for reordering.
3. **Deleting Multiple Images:**
   - Allow users to select multiple images and delete them.
   - Provide a clear visual indication of selected images.
4. **Setting Feature Image:**
   - Allow users to set a feature image by sorting.
   - Pretend the first image (from the LTR direction) as the featured image
   - The feature image should be visually distinct from the other images.
5. **User Experience:**
   - Ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
   - Implement transitions or animations for a polished look and feel.
6. **Live Demo:**
   - Host your React JS image gallery on any platform of your choice.
   - Share the live URL of your task with us for assessment.
   - Our verdict would be considered as rejected if your live URL link does not work.

## Guidelines:
- Use React JS for building the image gallery.
- You are free to use any additional libraries or frameworks as needed.
- Please do not use any image gallery library
- Pay attention to code organization, readability, and best practices.
- Include comments or documentation as necessary for clarity.
- Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes.


## Submission:
Provide us with the following:
- The source code of your React JS project through any version control software (Github, Gitlab, etc)
- A live URL where we can interact with your image gallery.

## Note:
Feel free to showcase your creativity and React JS skills in the implementation of the image gallery. We look forward to seeing your work!
